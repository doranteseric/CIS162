        <h1>Eric Dorantes</h1>
        <p>I am a serial entrepreneur, I have created two start-ups and I recently was hired at a company that is past its second round of funding. I have been on a ptah of development since 2015 when I decided I would teach myself how to code because I had a good idea. That idea came to fruition in 2016 with the creation of an app called Maphash. That app saw a small user base but was eventually scraped due to competition with Snapchat. I have produced other apps including a dj Light for your phone called Ravecandy, and an on-demand pharmaceutical delivery app called Access Driven. My last start-up was called Status and was on-demand fuel delivery driven through a mobile app for both iOS and Android.</p>
